# Foundations in Bioinformatics

**Building the essential skills for computational biology**

---

## Course Overview

This course provides foundational knowledge in bioinformatics and computational biology, teaching you how biological molecules and processes are abstracted into data that can be analyzed computationally.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this course, you will be able to:

1. **Understand Biological Data** - Comprehend how biological reality becomes digital data
2. **Program for Bioinformatics** - Write Python programs for biological data analysis
3. **Access Biological Databases** - Query and retrieve data from biological databases programmatically
4. **Perform Sequence Alignments** - Execute and interpret sequence alignment algorithms
5. **Apply Statistical Methods** - Use appropriate statistical approaches for genomic data

---

## For Students

### Prerequisites

- Basic molecular biology knowledge (DNA, RNA, proteins, central dogma)
- Basic computer skills (file systems, text editors)
- No programming experience required (taught in Module 2)

### How to Use This Course

1. **Read modules sequentially** - Each builds on previous knowledge
2. **Complete exercises** - Hands-on practice is essential
3. **Review examples** - Study code and explanations carefully
4. **Practice with real data** - Apply skills to actual biological datasets
5. **Ask questions** - Use discussion forums or office hours

### Time Commitment

- **Full course**: 14 weeks (3-5 hours per week)
- **Per module**: 2-3 weeks
- **Self-paced**: Work at your own speed

---

## Getting Started

### Required Software

All software is free and open-source:

- **Python 3.9+** (Anaconda distribution recommended)
- **BioPython** library
- **Text editor** (VS Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive coding)

### Installation Guide

See detailed setup instructions in Module 2.

## Course Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

- **Conceptual understanding before programming** - Understand what data represents before manipulating it
- **Hands-on practice** - Learn by doing, not just reading
- **Real-world applications** - Work with actual biological data from publications
- **Reproducible workflows** - Learn best practices from the start
- **Critical thinking** - Question assumptions and evaluate data quality
